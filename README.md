CineBook - A MERN Stack Movie Ticket Booking Application
CineBook is a full-stack web application for browsing movies, viewing details, registering users, logging in, booking tickets, and managing booking history. It's built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable solution for online movie ticket reservations.

‚ú® Features
Movie Browsing: View a list of available movies with essential details like genre, description, duration, and rating.

Movie Details: Click on any movie to see comprehensive information including director, cast, showtimes, and ticket price.

User Authentication:

Registration: Create a new user account with secure password hashing (using bcryptjs).

Login: Authenticate users with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management.

Logout: Securely end user sessions.

Ticket Booking:

Select showtimes and number of tickets for any movie.

Authenticated users can confirm bookings, with automatic price calculation.

Booking History: Logged-in users can view a personalized list of all their past and current bookings.

Cancel Booking: Users can cancel their own active bookings from their history.

Responsive Design: Basic styling ensures usability across different devices.

MongoDB Atlas Integration: Cloud-hosted database for persistent data storage.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Backend (Node.js/Express.js)

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing movie and user data.

Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

bcryptjs: For hashing and salting passwords securely.

jsonwebtoken (JWT): For creating and verifying authentication tokens.

dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.

cors: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Frontend (React)

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Hooks: For managing state and side effects in functional components.

fetch API: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

localStorage: For persisting user login state.

Standard CSS (Inline/index.css): For styling and responsiveness.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get CineBook up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher recommended) & npm (comes with Node.js)

MongoDB Atlas Account (or a local MongoDB instance)

Postman (or similar API testing tool) for initial movie data seeding

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CineBook.git
cd CineBook

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the backend directory and set up the server.

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory:
This file will store your sensitive environment variables.

# backend/.env

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=a_very_long_and_random_string_for_jwt_security

MONGO_URI: Get this from your MongoDB Atlas cluster (Network Access must allow your IP, and Database Access must have a user). It will look something like mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@clustername.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=YourAppName.

JWT_SECRET: Generate a strong, random string. You can use node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))" in your terminal to generate one.

Start the Backend Server:

node server.js

The server should start on http://localhost:5000 and connect to MongoDB.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory.

cd ../frontend # Go back to the root, then into frontend
npm install

Start the Frontend Development Server:

npm start

The React app should open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

4. Seed Initial Movie Data (Using Postman)
Your application needs movie data to display. Use Postman to add movies to your database.

Backend Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/movies
Method: POST
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body: Select raw and JSON. Use the following JSON array, sending each movie object as a separate POST request.
